                <li>After the grill has come to 450 degrees, place the steaks on the grill, and cook for four to four and a half minutes per side.</li>
                <li>Cook times may vary slightly depending on the grill and size of cuts, but remove at the recommended time for a medium-rare cook.</li>
                <li>Let the steak rest for at least 5 minutes before cutting to ensure ti reabsorbes the juices. </li>
